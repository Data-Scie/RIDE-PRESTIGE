## Service Layer (Backend Integration)

All services are in `services/`. They currently use mock data but are structured for real API integration:

| Service | File |
|---------|------|
| Auth | `services/authService.ts` |
| Affiliate | `services/affiliateService.ts` |
| Driver | `services/driverService.ts` |
| Jobs | `services/jobService.ts` |
| Vehicles | `services/vehicleService.ts` |
| Documents | `services/documentService.ts` |
| Earnings | `services/earningsService.ts` |
| Notifications | `services/notificationService.ts` |

To connect a real backend, replace the mock `delay()` functions with `fetch()` or `axios` calls.

---

## Design Language

Matches the Customer-End app:

- **Background**: `#030303` (near-black)
- **Gold accent**: `#D7B46A` (Rose Gold)
- **Button gold**: `#C9A24A`
- **Text**: `#F8F3EF` (warm white)
- **Muted**: `#B8B0A4`
- **Card bg**: `#111211`
- **Border**: `#342F24`
- **Font**: Avenir Next (iOS) / sans-serif-medium (Android)

---

## Status Logic (Mock)

The app implements local mock state for the full job lifecycle:

1. `awaiting_affiliate` → Affiliate accepts → `needs_allocation`
2. `needs_allocation` → Assign driver → `driver_assigned`
3. `driver_assigned` → Assign vehicle → `vehicle_assigned`
4. `vehicle_assigned` → Driver accepts → `driver_accepted`
5. `driver_accepted` → Start journey → `on_route`
6. `on_route` → Arrive pickup → `arrived_pickup`
7. `arrived_pickup` → Passenger boards → `passenger_onboard`
8. `passenger_onboard` → Complete ride → `completed`

---

## Notes

- All mock data uses UK-based Ride Prestige locations (Manchester Airport, Heathrow, Sheffield, Leeds, etc.)
- No changes were made to the Customer-End app
- This app runs independently with its own package.json
- The `@/` import alias resolves to the project root
